# Forum

This is a little forum build with a MVC pattern. I made it during my training. 


## Author

- [@mayados](https://www.github.com/mayados)


## About
I made it using HTML5, CSS3 and PHP

You will find : 
- Register form
- Login form
- Topics
- Categories
- Create new Topics
- Profile page
- User's page
- Create new post
- Admin side (ban / close topics / add categories..)



To see the project, you can, for example, put this link in the url :
http://localhost/forum/index.php?ctrl=security&action=directionInscription
